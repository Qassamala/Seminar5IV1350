This code represents the flow at a point of sale at a retail store. 
This assignment was part of the course IV1350 (Object-Oriented Design) given at KTH,
and is the work done for seminar 5.

For seminar 5, I will implement an additional design pattern, using the Template Method design pattern, in order to remove duplicated code in the two observers TotalRevenueFileOutput and TotalRevenueView. 

The code can run and will result in printouts of events according to a requirements specification.
